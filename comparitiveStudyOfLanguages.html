Array / List 



js - iterations methods 
In JavaScript, the for...of loop is used to iterate over the values of an iterable object,
such as an array, string, Map, or Set. 
It gives you direct access to each element’s value,
making it ideal when you only care about the data itself.
On the other hand, the for...in loop is used to iterate over the keys (or property names) of an object. It’s commonly used for looping through object properties rather than array elements. While for...in works with objects and returns the keys as strings, for...of works with iterables and returns their actual values. Therefore, for...of is better suited for arrays and other iterable structures, while for...in is typically used for plain JavaScript objects.
<pre>
<code>
const arr = ["a", "b", "c"];
for (const x of arr) console.log(x); // a, b, c
for (const x in arr) console.log(x); // 0, 1, 2
</code>
</pre>
js - array

const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "mango"];
console.log(fruits.includes("banana")); // true
console.log(fruits.includes("ban"));  // false , full element should match





string 

string - js 

// string matching js
const text = "JavaScript is fun";
console.log(text.includes("Script")); // true
console.log(text.includes("script")); // false (case-sensitive)

// string matching python
string - pyton 
text = "Python is awesome"
print("Python" in text)     # ✅ True
print("python" in text)     # ❌ False (case-sensitive)


different naming conventions
naming conventions — 
ways to write multi-word names (like variables, functions, classes) in code

| Style      | Example     | Common Use Case                          |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| camelCase  | `userName`  | JS variables, functions, object keys     |
| PascalCase | `UserName`  | Classes, React components                |
| snake_case | `user_name` | Python, databases, environment variables |
| kebab-case | `user-name` | CSS class names, HTML attributes         |
