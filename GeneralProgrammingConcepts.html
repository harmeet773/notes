initialization vs assignment vs declaration 
 
Declaration means telling the compiler/interpreter that a variable (or function) exists and what type it is (if applicable).
int x;  // declaration

Initialization means giving a variable its first value (often at the time of declaration).
int x = 10;  // declaration + initialization

Assignment means giving or updating the value of a variable after it has already been declared (and possibly initialized).
int x;      // declaration
x = 10;     // initialization (first assignment)
x = 20;     // reassignment (new value)


node.js is single threaded non-blocking Asynchronous framework.
linux treats threads as sub-proces and windows treats threads as actual threads.

<br/>

async / await - we write a async function and every code that's blocking we write await to it . it will act Asynchronously but look synchrounously.

Async = makes a function return a promise.
Await = makes an async function wait for a promise. Await can only be 
used inside an async function.
Async/Await  
// Allows you write asynchronous code in a synchronous manner
// Async doesn't have resolve or reject parameters
// Everything after Await is placed in an event queue

<br/>

with help of  multi process programming we can run the code on different machines . For example a function that bruteforces.

  How JS Converts Expressions Into Boolean?
</a>

<div id="CORS" class="collapse">

  <p>
    JavaScript’s <code>ToBoolean</code> operation converts any expression into a boolean.  
    <strong>Why is conversion required?</strong><br>
    Because the <code>while(expr)</code> loop runs only when 
    <code>ToBoolean(expr) === true</code>.

  <p>A smaller execution unit within a process that shares the same memory with other threads inside the same process .</p>

<p>
event listeners  - event listeners listens to the subscribed event , they get invoked every time the event happens , as long as the listener is active.
Instead of listening to event listener on DOM we can listen on specific elements of DOM , etc .</p>



Namespaces are used to organize code and prevent naming conflicts by grouping related classes and components under a logical container. Languages like C#, C++, Java (packages), Python (modules), PHP, TypeScript, Go, and Rust support namespaces or similar concepts.
