initialization vs assignment vs declaration 
 
Declaration means telling the compiler/interpreter that a variable (or function) exists and what type it is (if applicable).
int x;  // declaration

Initialization means giving a variable its first value (often at the time of declaration).
int x = 10;  // declaration + initialization

Assignment means giving or updating the value of a variable after it has already been declared (and possibly initialized).
int x;      // declaration
x = 10;     // initialization (first assignment)
x = 20;     // reassignment (new value)


node.js is single threaded non-blocking Asynchronous framework.
linux treats threads as sub-proces and windows treats threads as actual threads.


async / await - we write a async function and every code that's blocking we write await to it . it will act Asynchronously but look synchrounously.

with help of  multi process programming we can run the code on different machines . For example a function that bruteforces. 
<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="h4">Process</h3>
  <p>An instance of a program with its own address space, resources, and execution state.</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="h4">Thread</h3>
  <p>A smaller execution unit within a process that shares the same memory with other threads inside the same process .</p>
</div>

<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="h4">Process</h3>
  <p><strong>process -</strong> A process is an independent program in execution.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Key Points</h5>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      Has its own memory (RAM space).
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      Has its own CPU time, stack, heap, file handles.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      Crashing one process doesn't affect others.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>Examples:</strong> Chrome.exe, VSCode.exe, python.exe
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>
<div class="mb-4">
  <h3 class="h4">Thread</h3>
  <p><strong>What is a Thread?</strong> A thread is the smallest unit of execution inside a process.</p>

  <h5 class="mt-3">Key Points</h5>
  <ul class="list-group list-group-flush">
    <li class="list-group-item">
      Threads share the memory of the process.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      Lightweight compared to a process.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      One process can have multiple threads.
    </li>
    <li class="list-group-item">
      <strong>Examples:</strong> A browser tab, file download thread, render thread.
    </li>
  </ul>
</div>

<p>
event listeners  - event listeners listens to the subscribed event , they get invoked every time the event happens , as long as the listener is active.
Instead of listening to event listener on DOM we can listen on specific elements of DOM , etc .</p>
