initialization vs assignment vs declaration 

Declaration means telling the compiler/interpreter that a variable (or function) exists and what type it is (if applicable).
int x;  // declaration

Initialization means giving a variable its first value (often at the time of declaration).
int x = 10;  // declaration + initialization

Assignment means giving or updating the value of a variable after it has already been declared (and possibly initialized).
int x;      // declaration
x = 10;     // initialization (first assignment)
x = 20;     // reassignment (new value)
